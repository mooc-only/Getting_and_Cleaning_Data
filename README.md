# Getting and Cleaning Data. Course Project 

This is the repository to evaluate the course project.  
We are using the UCI HAR Dataset to perform the operations and obtain the tidy data sets requested.

## About the script

The script is completely autonomous. You just have to download the file "run_analysis.R" and 'source' it - you don't have to download manually the dataset if you don't want to.  

In case that you download it, put the script at the same level of the .zip file or the unzipped folder, not inside the folder of the data set. All the files are created at the same level of the script.
